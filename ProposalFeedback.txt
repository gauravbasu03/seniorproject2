Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Connekt
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Gaurav, this is a very good idea!  I really like that you are doing a
   project that will help people, especially students.  I think the idea of
   this application is really good, but I do think there is a LOT of work to
   do with this product with only one person to do the work.  It would be a
   good idea to think about all the parts you are planning, write them down,
   then prioritize them so that you can have an idea of what a "successful"
   project will be for the semester.  Then plan those parts out so that they
   are in some sort of sequence, whether a linear 'waterfall' order or in an
   'iterative' agile order.  If you get to the end and have some time left,
   you can always add another piece.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Your presentation is very nice, quite professional-looking.  I like your
   use of graphics to tell the story!  One area for possible improvement is
   your grammar ~ there are a couple of awkward phrasings on slide two, even
   for bullet format.  Be sure to double-check before you present next time!

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Great start to the semester, and keep it up, Gaurav!
