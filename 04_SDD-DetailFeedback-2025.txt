Very fine work on this document with just a couple of comments on diagrams.

A "use case" diagram shows the system in a box and the operations that the
system performs as ovals inside the box.  Anything that interacts with the
system is OUTSIDE the box and is labeled as an "actor" which is a stick
figure.  Your diagram shows the data flow through the system, but without
any detail.

When putting text into boxes, you should center only the name of the box at
the top, then everything else should be left-justified.  Having everything
centered looks a little off.  What exactly ARE the relationships between
the classes?  It's a bit hard to tell.  You could add notations to the
association lines which would help the reader understand.

For an Entity-Relationship Diagram, you need to show not only what the
table name and fields are, but you should also show what the primary key and
any other keys are [foreign keys, etc] in the tables.

Good work, though ~ keep it up!
