Comments:
---------

You generally have well-thought-out answers to these questions, Guarav.  The
   architecture questions you really did well with.

problem 5-8 I notice you don't have an "accept" state to stop the processing,
   but I get the idea.  The rest of the diagram looks good.

problem 6-2 remember that in UML the inheritance arrow points to the super
   class, not to the subclasses.  Also, I think the 'Text' class is not a
   shape but it IS a 'Drawable' so it should be associated with that class
   instead.  I don't think you want 'Linelength' as a class, since that is
   a property of a line.  Lastly, the attributes you have places in the
   'Shape' class should be pushed up to the 'Drawable' class.  Still, good
   effort!

Excellent work ~ keep it up!
