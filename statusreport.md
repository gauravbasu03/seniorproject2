Status Report

Week 7 - so far so good

1. Completed Tasks
- Web Map Loaded - The esri webmap dark theme succesfully loads when I run the app.
- Indeed API integration - The indeed api does in fact return a list of jobs related to the search query and location geography.
- Geography Updates when you change location - We an update the geography and commute distance but the location requires a full address.

2. Ongoing Tasks
- Trying to get the Zillow api to work
- Need to get Esri API Key for the Business Analyst API

3. Issues/Challenges
- One of the issues I am facing is that I don't really know how  to integrate Firebase into this project. I don't think that it is really a priority with this many moving parts at this point.
- I am trying to figure out how to leverage my knowledge of OpenAI's api to suggest cities to work in. I'm a bit lost in terms of the flow of the app from start to finish. But I do know how to make it functional.
