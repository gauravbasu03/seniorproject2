============================================================================

Your score: 48 out of 50 = 96% which is an A

Comments/feedback:

problem 7-1, I bet you could remove even more comments if you think about it
   but what you have is fine.

problem 8-11, the lincoln index should be calculated for PAIRS of testers.
   Testing the three different Lincoln indexes:
   Alice/Bob 5*4/2 = 10
   Alice/Carmen 5*5/2 = 12.5
   Bob/Carmen 4*5/1 = 20
   To estimate the bug you could take the average of the three.
   In this case, there are (10 + 12.5 + 20) / 3 = 14 bugs.

Nice work, Gaurav ~ you earned 10.56 of 11 extra credit points.
