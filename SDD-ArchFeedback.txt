COMMENTS

Nice job on this preliminary document!  I like the way you have organized
the sections and the way you describe each of the parts.  You went above
and beyond by describing some of the attributes in the classes, which wasn't
necessary for a top-level document, but it never hurts to have a bit more
information than needed here.

Good work and keep it up!
